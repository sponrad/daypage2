Daypage2 - Notes by Day

## About

This is version 2 of Daypage, a day-centric note-taking app I have been working on.

Design goals:
* Painless note taking
* Organized by Day
* Robust search
* Tracking of when and how much was written, similar to Githubs calendar
* Built in tools that I have not completely decided yet, eg calculator, todo/favorites, tagging
* Sharing and collaboration features (probably not real time simultaneous editing)
